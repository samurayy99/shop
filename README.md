# Webshop Redesign Collaboration Guide

## Project Overview
- **Type**: E-commerce Webshop
- **Objective**: Transition to a Single Page Application (SPA) with a focus on minimalistic design, user-friendliness, and maximized server-side operations for enhanced security and anonymity.

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Laravel (PHP)
- **Frontend**: Transition from jQuery to a suitable SPA framework.



## Detailed Technical Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Laravel (PHP)
- **Authentication**: Managed through `AuthController.php` (username, password, captcha).
- **Bitcoin Transactions**: Managed by `BitcoinCheck.php`.
- **Validation**: Utilizes Laravelâ€™s built-in validation, including captcha validation.
- **Routes**: Defined within `web.php`
- **Middleware**: Includes custom middleware for specific functionalities.
- **Service Providers**: Potential usage of custom service providers.

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technologies**: JavaScript (jQuery), HTML/CSS (Blade templates).
- **Captcha**: Implemented within login forms.
- **Assets**: CSS and JS stored within `/public/app-assets/`.
- **Client-Side Logic**: Managed by scripts like `/public/app-assets/js/scripts/pages/auth-login.js`.



### File and Directory Structure
- **Backend Logic**: `app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php`.
- **Frontend Forms**: `/resources/views/auth/login.blade.php` and `/resources/views/auth/register.blade.php`.

- **Product & Category Management**: Managed through the admin area, with a crucial presentation on the one-page layout.

## Future Layout Details
- **Hero Header**: No navigation bar, menu items integrated into the hero section.
- **About Us**: Section just below the hero header.
- **Product Category Buttons**: Two attractive buttons with category pictures as backgrounds, opening a modal displaying products from the selected category upon click.

## Undesired Functionalities to be Removed
