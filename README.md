# Webshop Redesign Collaboration Guide

## Project Overview
- **Type**: E-commerce Webshop
- **Objective**: Transition to a Single Page Application (SPA) with Laravel, Vue 3, and Inertia.js.

## Current State
Our existing webshop is built with Laravel and jQuery. It has various features such as product & category management, user authentication, Ticket function and Bitcoin transactions.

## Desired Changes
The new design should be minimalistic and user-friendly. It should include a hero header, an "About Us" section, and product category buttons. We want to remove the navigation bar and integrate the menu items into the hero section. The authentication mechanism should use username, password, and captcha without utilizing email.

## Removed Functionalities
We have removed certain functionalities including FAQ, top seller, product stock, custom CSS controller, news, and Jabber functionalities.
