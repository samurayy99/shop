### Framework Utilized
- Laravel (PHP)

### Key Components and Functionalities
- **Authentication**: Managed through `AuthController.php`, utilizing username, password, and captcha for user authentication.
- **Bitcoin Transactions**: Handled by `BitcoinCheck.php`. Specific details and logic need further exploration.
- **Validation**: Utilizes Laravelâ€™s built-in validation mechanisms, including captcha validation.
- **Routes**: Defined within `web.php` and `api.php`.
- **Middleware**: Includes custom middleware for specific functionalities.
- **Service Providers**: Potential usage of custom service providers for specific functionalities.

## Frontend Architecture

### Technologies and Frameworks
- **JavaScript**: Currently utilizing jQuery for client-side scripting.
- **HTML/CSS**: Utilizing Blade templates, stored within `/resources/views/`.

### Key Components and Functionalities
- **Captcha**: Implemented within login forms for additional security during authentication.
- **Assets**: CSS and JS assets are stored within `/public/app-assets/`.
- **Client-Side Logic**: Managed by various scripts, such as `/public/app-assets/js/scripts/pages/auth-login.js`.

# File and Directory Structure (Key Components)

- **Backend Logic**: Managed within `app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php`.
- **Frontend Forms**: Stored within `/resources/views/auth/login.blade.php` and `/resources/views/auth/register.blade.php`.
- **Main Layout**: Defined within `/resources/views/base.blade.php`.
- **JavaScript Logic**: Managed by scripts like `/public/app-assets/js/scripts/pages/auth-login.js`.
- **Middleware**: Stored within `app/Http/Middleware/`.

# Vision for Future SPA Redesign

- **Showcase Products**: Display products with images, descriptions, and prices.
- **Shopping Cart**: Enable users to add products to a shopping cart.
- **Product & Category Management**: Managed through the admin area, with a crucial presentation on the one-page layout.

## Future Layout Details
- **Hero Header**: No navigation bar, menu items integrated into the hero section.
- **About Us**: Section just below the hero header.
- **Product Category Buttons**: Two attractive buttons with category pictures as backgrounds, opening a modal displaying products from the selected category upon click.

# Authentication Details

- The application uses a username, password, and captcha for authentication, without utilizing email.
- [Further details and implementation logic to be explored]

# Bitcoin and Ticket Functionalities

- **Bitcoin Transactions**: Managed by `BitcoinCheck.php`. [Additional details to be explored and documented]
- **Ticket System**: [Details and implementation logic to be explored and documented]

# MVC Architecture in the Webshop

- **Models**: Represent data structures, interacting with the database, performing data processing, and defining relationships between data entities.
- **Views**: Display data to the user, generating HTML sent to the browser.
- **Controllers**: Handle user requests, coordinating models and views, receiving input from the user, interacting with models to process data, and passing data to views to be displayed.
- **Routes**: Define URLs and map them to specific controller actions.
- **Middleware**: Filter HTTP requests entering the application.
- **Service Providers**: Bootstrap the Laravel application.
- **Eloquent ORM**: Interact with the database using object-oriented syntax.
- **Artisan Console**: Provide helpful commands for common tasks.
- **Blade Templating Engine**: Allow the use of plain PHP code in views.
